# Edwin's Portfolio

I chose to build this atrocity in an effort to market myself in this competitive world.

## Creation and Walkthrough
### What i going to cover here...
1. build.
2. Choice of stack.
3. Difficulties
4. Next move.
5. Things i have learnt.

## Build 
I choose to go with a simple stack of simple Html and CSS to just practice the basics.Honestly i Just vibe-coded the Whole thing with chat-gpt
and the back-end is powered by go, a language i have been learning for the fun of it and influence.

## Choice of stack
This was really decided upon due to the fact that am not a web dev or a front-end guy for that matter.I am just a simple guy dealing with the networks and feeling excited by the data packets of your hot-sites...and linux administration
  just putting it out there...i use linux BTW..
and of late i have been getting itchy by the Devops path.
I have been taking this course by Nana...you know..Techworld with Nana

## Difficulties
The problems am having with this are just not really a headache if you think of it 
1. I tried working with a lighter theme but..man that drove the a.i to an asylum...the phase where it starts going delulu..
2. The contact forms are not easy to work with in go since hosting a go-powered site in vercel is not an easy task.This forced me to have a work around and had to use a free resource called Formspree to handle the email submissions but it seems to need some work too.
3. Securing a custom domain name is also not easy since i don't really have the cash to do that as for now.This forces me to have to use the generated domain by vercel and as you know those domain names are as tasty as last week's soup..on a light note.

## Next move 
The thing that i plan next on working with this is that i want to use a simpler way of building,e.g by using a front-end  framework like vue or react or even svelte.. so as to just have it easy.

I also want to write an astounding resume and use it, seriously an empty sample.pdf file for  a resuem ain't gonna cut it.
 ## Things i have learnt
1. Woring with A.I if you have no idea of the working is on a greater level, pointless.I have seen people buid alot of things with it but eventually the headache is enough to teach you that you should have just learnt how to do it yourself.
*this reminds me of the spiderman's movie "far from home"* where he and the friend do some hacks on the suit provided by stark.They override the training wheels module that was meant to train him on how to use the suit powered by A.I "Karen" and eventually he just have to learn and take a refresher course on how to use the suit...artifical intelligence is good but in the unexperienced hands ,you are just creating alot more jobs for people by introducing bugs,vulnerabilities,flaws ....
Just learn how to use and control the power in your hands...
